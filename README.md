# Estimation of two-dimensional unitary transformations
This repository contains the implementation of a method, described in Appenix E in Ref. [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12699), to estimate two-dimensional 
unitary transformations. 

In a numerical study in Ref. [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12699), we compare our method against the qiskit's built-in function [3](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/experiments/stubs/qiskit_experiments.library.tomography.ProcessTomography.html) for standard quantum process tomography (SQPT) [3](https://doi.org/10.1080/09500349708231894).
